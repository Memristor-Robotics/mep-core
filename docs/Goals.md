## Modular 
Every driver or service can be easily replaced and tested separately.

## Team orientated
There is big picture & every module is separated.

## Easy & fast to make a change 
Because it is JIT you don't have compile and transfer over the network

## Fast learning curve
Software should be well organized and documented.

## Tested 
Every module should be tested using Unit tests.

## Package manager 
Don't rewrite software, if there is already packet written use it.

## Hardware independent 
Services should be independent of drivers, practically that means if 
we disable LidarDriver TerrainService should work just fine.

## Logging system 
Elastic Search & Kibana will help us to find a bugs.
