# Software Design Inspiration

## Previous Memristor's software
The most of concepts are taken by previous software built by Pandurov.

## ROS
Publish/Subscribe system is inspired by ROS.

## Android 
Necessarily module name in Android's Log class is great, and we also have it.

## Yii
Ability to change module's class path in config file is implemented in Yii framework.
Also as Yii has global object Yii we have global object **Mep** which provides custom require function,
access to configuration and logging system.
