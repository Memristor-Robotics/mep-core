# Goals
- Modular (every driver or service can be easily replaced and tested separately),
- Adapted to team (there is big picture & every module is separated),
- Easy & fast to make change (because it JIT you don't have compile & transfer over the network),
- Fast learning curve (software should be well organized and documented),
- Tested (every module should be tested using Unit tests),
- Package manager (don't rewrite software, if there is already packet written use it),
- Logging system (Elastic Search & Kibana will help us to find bugs).
