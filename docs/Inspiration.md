# Inspiration

## Previous Memristor's software
The most of concepts are taken by previous software built by Pandurov.

## ROS
Publish/Subscribe system is inspired by ROS.

## Android 
Like Android's Service Manager and generally managers in Android platform 
our software has DriverManager, ServiceManager, LaserManager...
Necessarily module name in Android's Log class is great, and we will
also use it.
 
## Yii
Ability to change module's class path in config file is implemented in 
Yii framework. Also as Yii has global object Yii we have global object 
**Mep** which provides custom require function, access to configuration 
and logging system.
